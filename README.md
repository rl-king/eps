## Todo
* Filter code out of docs
* Stem text for indexing
* Extract factual information to help rank packages
  * How complete are the docs
    * Examples
  * Does it have tests
  * Dependencies


## Getting started
Most recent work is on `dev` branch

```
all -- compile haskell and elm
clearcache -- remove all files in ./cache
elm -- compile elm to ./index.html
haskell -- compile haskell
server -- start haskell server
watch -- watch haskell files and compile on change
```
